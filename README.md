## 1.Introduction
- **Objective**: Basically, in this project, the objective of this machine learning project is to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year based on over 13 features. We are going to focus on building an 'income' classification model. To be more specific, we write 7 algorithms scratch without using Sklearn, which includes 1 dimension reduction, and 6 classification algorithms to train our model and evaluate the goal by metrics. 
- **Method**: 
- **Comparation**: Finally, we set the 4 dataset scenario including baseline(ad_df)and the other 3 dataset by improvement, and compare the model from metrics perspective, bias-variance-tradeoff perspective, optimization perspective and space and time consumption perspective to conduct model selection and explore the interpretability.
